Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
I overloaded the following methods:
    + House class: moveIn(..). I added 2 options of moving 2 roommates in at once and moving 3 suitemates in at once.
    + Library class: returnBook(...) & checkOut(...). I added the options of returning 2 books at once and checking out 2 books at once.
    + Cafe class: sellCoffee(...). I added a non-sweet option and a non-dairy option.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I wanted to be able to return multiple books at once, but my code did not execute as expected, so I went with the present option. I hope to improve it in the future! Everything else works as expected. I would advise that person to make sure they got override and overload separated, because they are easy to be mixed up.
